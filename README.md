# Machine Learning in Eighteen Months

##### Forseeing requirements for this .Net Core project, I am compiling a list of available books to read, optionally. This list will change.

For this project, on my requirements are:
ML.NET 
Apache for .NET
LinqInfer
dotNetRDF
CNTK
and maybe a Compressor package if .Net Core doesn't suffice
